 <P style=text-indent: 40px;>This chapter looks at factors that promote development and implementation
of successful online distance learning environments from the perspectives
of educators and learners. It provides an overview of current tensions
between the requirements of the faculty, the needs of the students, and the
forces driving the development of online programs. The work is based on the
authors’ current research as well as past experiences in the design, development,
and delivery of online distance learning environments.</P>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Today’s learners are demanding “anytime and anywhere education,” and
institutions are responding by committing substantial resources to providing</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>online distance learning through courses and full degree programs at the
post-secondary and high school levels. Such courses and programs may
include some face-to-face interaction, but the teacher and student are
separated for the majority of activities. One or more forms of technology
are used to mediate the teaching, and several forms of technology may be
used for communication.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Distance education has long been viewed as a way in which to offer
lifelong learning to those who are geographically separated from traditional
institutions, have obligations that limit their ability to attend regular courses,
or prefer to learn in new ways. One challenge has been to balance the need for
intense and personal interaction with the reality of limited financial and other
resources. Organizations and universities have turned to technology that has
evolved to the point where it can provide the needed experiences through
electronic networks and groupware (Gerencher, 1998; Mangan, 1999; Schrum,
1998). This chapter presents a review of the trend towards online distance
learning environments by identifying challenges to faculty, students, and
program planners.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Several previous studies were analyzed and amalgamated in this chapter.
Schrum and Benson (2000a; 2000b; 2000c) investigated the first two years of
a collaborative effort between a large financial corporation and a large
southeastern university College of Business’s MBA program to provide
expanded learning opportunities for the corporation’s professional workers
who wished to further their education while maintaining full-time employment.
In a qualitative case study of a distance learning consortium launched
by the university system of a southeastern state, Benson (2001) described and
analyzed the planning and implementation of the consortium’s first online
degree programs from the perspectives of the primary stakeholders: the
consortium planning committee, the administrators at the universities providing
the courses, the instructors developing and delivering the courses, the
students enrolled in the courses, the university system administration, and the
business community with workforce needs. Schrum (1998; 2000) identified
characteristics of successful online learners, based on literature and interviews.
In a qualitative case study of students enrolled in two online school
library media courses at a large southeastern university, Benson et al. (in
press) and Tallman and Benson (2000) investigated the effectiveness of
online course delivery for the university’s school library media program.
From these four studies and the relevant literature, the authors have identified</p><br><hr><br>
 <p>factors that influence educators’ success in teaching in this context, specific
dimensions that appear to influence student success, and factors that contribute
to the overall success in creating online programs.</p> 
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">CONSIDERATIONS OF DISTANCE LEARNING
FOR EDUCATORS</h1>
    <h2>Teaching in Online Distance Learning Environments</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Educators face specific challenges in moving from their comfort zone
in traditional classrooms to teaching in online distance environments.
Faculty members have had an especially difficult time changing the ways
in which they teach, regardless of their own personal use of electronic
media (Candiotti & Clarke, 1998). In an online environment, the role of
faculty changes in many ways. Specifically, the traditional hierarchy is
flattened, and the power and control are redistributed. Faculty are forced
to develop and design their activities and interactions in new ways, and
they may be frustrated without the ability to recognize students’ furrowed
brows (Schrum & Berge, 1998).</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Faculty members, with little knowledge or experience of teaching
online, also have voiced uncertainty about their abilities to provide
appropriate educational experiences and opportunities, design meaningful
interaction, and meet the needs of all their students. They worry about
the extra time demands necessary to teach successfully in this manner, and
specifically if meeting those time demands would be counted toward the
yardstick of promotion and tenure. Further, librarians voiced concerns
that some students who have few skills in evaluation of Web information,
bibliographic searching or retrieval strategies may take online classes.
Their worry is that this lack of knowledge would negatively impact
students’ success and learning.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kember (1995) urged instructors to work toward deep learning,
which requires moving away from excessive assignments, shallow assessments,
and lack of freedom in activities. Heeren and Lewis (1997)
suggested matching the media with the task, keeping media lean for tasks
that do not require much interaction such as electronic mail, and reserving
rich media for things that require more interaction and a broader spectrum
of activity. These challenges go far beyond the instructor’s need to be
comfortable with the reliance on technology to support their courses
(Schrum, 1998).</p><br><hr><br>
    <h2>Course Design in Online Distance Learning Environments</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Wiesenberg and Hutton (1996) identified three major challenges for the
online course designer to consider: accommodating the increased time for
delivery of the course (they estimate two or three times what is necessary for
a traditional course), the creation of a community online, and encouraging
students to become independent learners. Before any decisions can be made
about delivery or models, however, each instructor must make pedagogical
decisions about the fundamental goals of a course. The salient questions when
creating an educational experience have always been, “What are the instructional
and personal goals of this course for all students?” and “What is the
purpose of this course?” These are questions that all educators must ask
themselves when designing courses, and in general, they have become
comfortable and adept at doing this.</p>
    <p>The structure of the course, the planning for educational and personal
needs, and the teacher’s role must all be reconceptualized. It is clear that
active and independent learning must take place. The designer will have
to determine what actions will promote this type of learning. Further, from
adult learning theory, it is clear that authentic learning, relevant materials,
and negotiated assignments are required to ensure the participation,
involvement, and action necessary to meet these goals. This is an ideal
opportunity to create a Development Team, composed of a Subject Matter
Expert (SME), an instructional designer, and at least one person with
experience in distance education.</p>
    <h2>Evaluation in Online Distance Learning Environments</h2>
    <p>The nature of online teaching requires the instructor to rethink the
evaluation process as well. The evaluation component must be ongoing and
continual; just leaving everything to one midterm and a final paper would put
everyone at a disadvantage. The instructor must become familiar with each
student’s work, and the only way to accomplish that is through many
instructional activities. One possibility is to have weekly questions for
students to answer individually, even if the students are working on group
projects. They may have to answer a content question, or explain something
in the readings. They may also be asked to explain what they have done in the
various parts of the course.</p>
    <p>A feedback loop is also essential, so perhaps it is wise to include specific
times during the term when students fill out an anonymous questionnaire
regarding the progress and process of the course. Some faculty members have
included one question each week that requires students to consider various
aspects of the content, interaction, and affective reaction to the online</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>environment. It is important that the teacher respond to class concerns, when
possible, to demonstrate attention to students’ needs.</p>
    <h1>CHALLENGES OF ONLINE DISTANCE
LEARNING FOR LEARNERS</h1>
    <p>Learners face incredible challenges in adapting to online distance learning.
Cognitive science and software engineers suggest that individuals must
create mental models to be able to understand and internalize what is
happening in this new environment (Brandt, 1997). One study suggested that
students had to take time to move through the initial efforts of learning the
tools before they began constructing new knowledge (Yakimovicz & Murphy,
1995). Another study confirms the necessity for learners to have support to
learn and act out their roles in these situations (Olson & Bly, 1991).</p>
    <p>One graduate course demonstrated that even in the case of having
independent online lessons, it was useful to add a component that required
students to interact with their colleagues in some way (Dehler & Poirras-
Hernandez, 1998). Eastmond (1995) found that students reported feelings of
isolation if they didn’t keep up with the interactions, and had to be taught to
take personal responsibility for involving themselves. Similarly, it is important
to build in practice opportunities for the students to refine their evaluative
and analytical skills to be able to successfully use the enormous amount of
information on the Internet (King, 1998).</p>
    <p>In recent work, Schrum (2001) identified seven dimensions of student
success in online distance learning environments. These were the result of
investigations of assessment instruments and information gathering from
experienced online educators. While these dimensions are presented
separately, in reality they do not function independently. Rather, they are
similar to an organic system, and work together to support or challenge the
online learner.</p>
    <h2>Access to Tools</h2>
    <p>The first dimension concerns tools that students must have readily
available. Research has demonstrated that easy access to technology, at home
or at work, is one of the most significant contributors to success in online
learning environments (Benson & Wright, 1999; Bonk & Dennen, 1999;
Schrum, 1998). It is worthwhile to create a minimum standard for hardware
and software, including peripherals. An institution can provide a convenient
and effective way of ensuring that student equipment meets the standards by</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>offering a free mini-course to experiment with the components and also to
demonstrate exactly what an online learning experience might be like.</p>
    <h2>Technology Experience</h2>
    <p>While having convenient access to the tools is the first step, experience
using the tools for personal or work-related activities is also important. More
than one study has suggested that students who have little technological
experience delay learning new content while they learn the tools (Schrum,
1998; Yakimovicz & Murphy, 1995). Important experiences for new online
learners include writing documents using a word processor, printing, sending
email on a regular basis, sending and receiving files via email, conducting
searches through the World Wide Web, and accessing online information.</p>
    <p>Students who are comfortable and adept at these tools will be able to
solve small technical problems, such as rebooting their machine, installing
software, changing printer cartridges, and answering simple configuration
questions. They will also be able to distinguish between the
problems related to their individual hardware and software that they can
solve and those problems that are better referred to the system administrator
or institution for assistance.</p>
    <h2>Learning Preferences</h2>
    <p>Students may be concerned that they might miss traditional face-to-face
instruction. It is true that each person learns in a unique way—in general,
people know the ways in which they are best able to remember a phone
number or address. Some people will write it down, others will say it several
times, and still others will make a rhyme out of it. Each is appropriate for the
individual who uses it. It is important to recognize that when students learn
off-campus, individual strengths and weaknesses may be amplified (Bonk &
Dennen, 1999). Online instructors must have strategies that accommodate
these learning preferences.</p>
    <h2>Study Habits and Skills</h2>
    <p>One of the greatest benefits of learning in online distance environments
is also one of its greatest challenges. Learners appear to appreciate the greater
control over their learning, yet with that control comes substantial responsibility
for completing assignments and being prepared (Schrum & Benson,
2000c). Learners must be able to turn off the television and concentrate on
their work in a timely fashion, in order to stay on track in turning in
assignments. It is clear that those students who do not keep up with the class
and the coursework are in greater danger of dropping out. A student may need</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>to assess his/her basic academic proficiencies, such as skimming for information,
and then reading the important portions more carefully.</p>
    <h2>Goals and Purpose</h2>
    <p>Adults have a variety of reasons for seeking educational experiences, and
these may include a mandated upgrade of skills, a requirement for additional
credits to maintain licensure, a need to change careers, or a simple desire to
gain knowledge. Realization of these goals, however, is often subject to the
strength of the motivation that drives these desires (Benson, 1998; Schrum &
Benson, 2000a). Motivation describes the internal and external conditions
that influence behavior and is one of the most significant factors in persistence
in online learning (Schrum, 1998). A non-motivated student may experience
difficulty in completing an online course.</p>
    <h2>Lifestyle Factors</h2>
    <p>Today’s population leads extremely busy lives–with many adults
having obligations beyond work. These potential learners must determine
if they have 10-20 hours a week to devote to studying. They must also
ascertain if they have flexibility in their schedules, or if little room exists
for rearrangement. It is vital that learners have the full support of their
family, friends, and employers. When competing demands put stress on a
student, they often feel they must give up or minimize their studying to
keep peace in the family (Schrum & Benson, 2000c). It may also be helpful
for the student to find someone who has taken distance courses to act as
a mentor for support and advice.</p>
    <h2>Personal Traits and Characteristics</h2>
    <p>A few of the dimensions have touched on the ways in which individuals
study and learn, but this dimension offers a perspective on fundamental
ways in which individuals actually handle their daily activities, and
patterns of behavior that go far beyond school-related issues. This includes
examining the way one completes daily tasks. For example, is the
individual always on time for appointments, or do simple tasks get
forgotten in the midst of daily activities? Looking at our personal qualities
can be somewhat difficult, but it is an important step toward successful
online learning. If learners are aware of their deficiencies, they can seek
help in overcoming them. For example, Eastmond (1995) found students
must be instructed in ways to take personal responsibility for becoming
involved in the interactions and with their colleagues.</p><br><hr><br>
    <h1>CHALLENGES OF PROGRAM PLANNING FOR
ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING</h1>
    <p>Administrators and program planners face many challenges in adapting
degree and certificate programs to an online environment. The distance
education literature is short on program-level planning models (e.g., Holmberg,
1995; Knott, 1994; Rumble, 1986). For the most part, the literature has
focused on individual courses (e.g., Andriole, 1997; Benson, 1998; Benson
& Wright, 1999; Bourne et al., 1997; Cooper, 1999; Lauzon, 1992; Mason,
1998; Pincas, 1998). Recent research conducted by the authors suggests that
success with online distance learning at the program level require attention to
seven key areas: faculty development, technical support, student services,
curriculum design, program format, course design, and marketing.</p>
    <h2>Faculty Development</h2>
    <p>The strength of the faculty largely determines the success of any program,
traditional or online, but in an online distance learning program, faculty
development cannot be overemphasized. This development includes technical
training, pedagogical training, and administrative support.</p>
    <p>First, faculty must have more than a general familiarity with the technology
being used. Faculty teaching online for the first time have identified a
need for more familiarity with software and hardware (Benson, 2001). Faculty
members who are familiar with the technology and comfortable with its use
will be more likely to model appropriate use. Providing opportunities for
instructors to participate in an online course will give them needed experience
and allow them to experience the online environment as their students will.
Some organizations conduct a portion of the technology and pedagogical
training online to gain this benefit.</p>
    <p>Second, faculty need pedagogical training to be successful in this new
environment. In many ways the technology training and the pedagogical
training go hand-in-hand. Introducing faculty to the interactions model of
learning is an effective way to begin the pedagogical training. The interactions
model specifies four types of interactions required for an effective learning
environment: learner to instructor, learner to content, learner to learner, and
learner to technology (Hillman, Willis, & Gunawardena, 1994; Moore, 1989).
Once faculty start thinking of their courses in terms of these interactions, they
can be introduced to online tools that facilitate the interactions. For example,
asynchronous communication over a bulletin board or discussion list can
facilitate the learner to learner interaction.</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>Faculty also must have appropriate administrative support and concomitant
rewards if they are to be successful in an online environment. Faculty
members require freedom to perform in the online distance learning environment
without being forced to adhere unnecessarily to the restraints and
constraints of the traditional classroom. For example, the performance review
process for faculty teaching online must accommodate the differences between
teaching online and teaching in a traditional classroom. Peers of the
online instructor may not understand the additional demands on an instructor
teaching online and thus, may not account for those differences in their peer
reviews. Traditional course evaluations may not address the specifics of the
online course, so new course evaluations may need to be introduced into the
program structure. These evaluations may need to be delivered in nontraditional
ways (Schrum & Benson, 2000c).</p>
    <h2>Technical Support</h2>
    <p>Technical support is a mandatory requirement. Technical support goes
beyond providing continued technical training and includes the ongoing
support that faculty and students need. Faculty and students experiencing
online distance learning for the first time will run into problems; however,
these problems can be overcome if an adequate support system is provided.
Help Desk functions are now commonly associated with online distance
learning programs. Many institutions and organizations provide such functions
on a 24 hours/7 days a week basis to accommodate the “anytime,
anyplace” nature of online learning (Benson, 2001).</p>
    <h2>Student Services</h2>
    <p>Student Services are important in online distance learning environments.
Online students require all the support functions of traditional students: registration,
financial aide, bookstore, library services, counseling, and access to appropriate
equipment and technology. Since the online student is learning at a distance,
Student Services functions need to be provided online. It is obvious how a school’s
registration, financial aide, bookstore, and library functions can be put online, but
online counseling is a relatively new area (Benson, 2001).</p>
    <p>First, online learning students should be assigned a single counselor
whom they can contact for all issues related to their experience, and this
person should be trained to address a wide variety of student concerns. It
would be unfair to force the online student to have eight points of contact.
Second, this counselor must be knowledgeable about learning in an online
environment so that she or he can provide the specialized support required by
these learners.</p><br><hr><br>
    <h2>Curriculum Design</h2>
    <p>Choosing a curriculum for an online distance learning program is
nontrivial. Educational institutions want to assure that their online program
meets regional accreditation standards, and fortunately, many accreditation
associations have developed criteria. For example, traditional
standards require a fixed amount of face-to-face time for each credit hour
assigned to a course. Obviously, that requirement can’t be met in an online
distance learning environment, so a revised requirement is needed. Accrediting
agencies are beginning to examine these kinds of differences and
to provide alternative standards more suited to the online environment
(Benson, 2001).</p>
    <p>Another curriculum issue concerns the determination of which courses
to offer in the online program. Successful online programs have tended to
limit the number of student course options (Schrum & Benson, 2000a).
For example, a student in an on-campus MBA program may have seven
specialization areas from which to choose, while the online student may
only have two. As more students choose online program delivery, increased
options may be provided to them.</p>
    <p>A final curriculum issue deals with the structure of course offerings.
Programs may choose a cohort model, an independent study model, or
some variation of both. In the cohort model, students progress lock step
through the courses in the program, typically on a traditional school-year
schedule. In the independent study model, students are free to enroll in
courses at any time, and are given a fixed time to complete each course.
Few programs have chosen this latter option. Most choose a pure cohort
system, or a modified cohort system. In the modified cohort system,
students enroll in a course in the program and move through that course
in a lock-step fashion, but they don’t necessarily move through all the
courses in the program together (Benson, 2001).</p>
    <h2>Program Technologies</h2>
    <p>A key to program success in online distance learning environments is the
use of multiple technologies. Varying combinations of email, bulletin boards,
chat rooms, white boards, audio, and streaming media can provide significant
value to an online course. While instructors may be warned to avoid lecturing
online, recent research has shown that students have a favorable attitude
towards the use of narrated PowerPoint presentations to supplement their
coursework (Schrum & Benson, 2000b). Of course, not all students will find
all media equally valuable, but using multiple media will give students
choices and address a variety of learning style preferences.</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>Many programs have come to rely almost exclusively on online technologies
and ignore the value of using the telephone, fax, and even face-to-face
experiences to supplement the online experience. Online students should feel
as free to call an instructor during office hours as they do to send him or her
an email message, or visit him or her in a chat room. Programs using the cohort
model have found success with initial face-to-face sessions where they begin
building a sense of community among the enrolled students. For many
programs that initial face-to-face session is the only contact the cohort has;
other programs have chosen to infuse their design with multiple face-to-face
sessions (Schrum & Benson, 2000a). The choice depends on the nature of the
program and financial resources of the students who would have to travel to
the meeting site.</p>
    <h2>Course Design</h2>
    <p>Course design in the online distance learning environment is the focus of
much discussion and research. Everyone seems to agree that developing an
online course requires more than physically moving the course to the
electronic medium; rather, the course and its goals must be reconceptualized
for the new medium. Similarly, when moving an entire program, the courses
must be reconceptualized as part of the online program. For example, research
shows that asynchronous bulletin boards can be used to support the learnerlearner
interaction as well as higher-order thinking skills (Shapley, 2000);
thus, online instructors may want to make use of this tool. In reconceptualizing
the courses as part of an online program, faculty members may decide to have
a common bulletin board for discussion of topics related to multiple courses.
Alternatively, faculty members may choose to redistribute one course’s
content across multiple courses.</p>
    <p>All the courses in a single program may have a consistent look and feel.
Unless there is a valid reason dictated by course content and learning goals,
students should not be required to learn a new set of tools for each course in
the program. A tool set should be established at the program level, and those
tools used by all faculty.</p>
    <h2>Marketing and Pricing</h2>
    <p>Marketing and pricing the online program should not be ignored. Some
institutions have found success by entering into partnerships with corporations
to provide online degrees and programs for the corporations’ employees
(Schrum & Benson, 2000c). These institutions have been able to fully recover
their costs, and in many cases, make a profit. Other institutions have targeted
a specific student population in a specific subject area, and spent marketing</p><br><hr><br>
    <p>dollars to reach that population. No institution should take the “if we build it,
they will come” attitude.</p>
    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <p>This chapter has identified significant issues related to online distance
learning for educators, learners, and program planners. It synthesized
information from a growing literature base and included the results
of several studies that the authors have completed. But this article only
reflects the beginning of the trend towards online distance learning. Postsecondary
institutions are under pressure to provide greater access to
educational opportunities, and they face intense competition from industry
and for-profit companies for students’ attention. This pressure may
cause decisions to be made without full consideration, and the authors
suggest that larger ethical, legal, and social questions have yet to be
answered. Some of these include:</p>
   <p>· What will happen to intellectual property rights of professors who locate
       their resources online?</p>
<p>· Is it possible that less skilled workers might be hired to deliver these
    courses (Noble, 1998)?</p>
<p>· Will students become “guinea pigs” in experimental trials of online
    courses?</p>
<p>· Should students be paid for their participation, or at least be allowed to
    take the courses for free?</p>
<p>· Is it possible that education will become a compilation of individual</p>
    <p>The possibilities in the online world are immeasurable. Educators and the
public at large have an opportunity to take a proactive stand in the development
of courses and programs to insure that they are pedagogically sound,
organizationally strong, and programmatically effective. The result will be
the best possible online distance learning environments.</p>
